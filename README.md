# Puzzli Solver

An automated solver for my daily puzzle game, Puzzli. Try [Puzzli yourself here](https://puzzligame.com), or check out the [source code here](https://github.com/nlaris/puzzli-public).

## Features

- Algorithmically solves the daily Puzzli
- Displays the solving process using green squares to show the algorithm's "thought process"
- Automatically captures and uploads solution recordings to [@puzzli_solver](https://www.instagram.com/puzzli_solver/#) on Instagram

### Note

I built this project while learning to use [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). Big shoutout to Cursor
